<h1 align="centre">What is Laser?</h1> 

<p align="justify"> LASER is a student-run Engineering society based in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering department. We run multiple projects that span a broad range of fields and welcome new people to join at all times. All backgrounds and courses are welcome - even people who aren't interested in the technical side. Some of our current initiatives include an entry into the UKSEDS rocketry competition, microcontroller/personal project workshops, visits to engineering companies, and talks from experts in the industry. We want to create a friendly and social atmosphere where students can not only develop their engineering and management skills, but also gain important industrial skills that students donâ€™t tend to learn during their time in University.</p>
